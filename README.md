Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code over time.
why Github is popular
You can track who and when changes were made
You can have a repository with the full project on your machine.
You can collaborate on one project with other developers
How version control help in maintaining project integrity.
If two developers push same code they're able to merge conflicts
We are able to audit changes- who and when changes were made
code reviews- others in the team can review, comment and suggest changes before merging.
Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
Sign in to Github and create a new repo- give a repositroy name and the description of the repository
choose public/private visibility- choose public for open collaboration, choose private for limited accessibility.
Initialize important files- add a README- describes the purpose of the project, add a gitignore- tells GIT which files to exclude, choose a license- helps clarify how others can use/contribute to your code.
Finalize and create repository- review your settings/click create repository.

Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
importance of README file
Initial introduction- gives a quick understanding of what the project does.
project onboarding- new contributors can quickly learn how to set up a local environment.
What should be included
Project title and description
Installation and setup instructions
User guide/examples
Contribution guidelines- outlines how others can contribute.
Credits and acknowledgments
Contact/support- how to reach the maintainers for questions/support
How does it contribute to effective collaboration:
Reduce repetitive questions
sets expectations- makes it clear how to contribute
builds community- can encourage new participants to get involved.
saves time- helps onboard new collaborators quickly and efficiently.

Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
